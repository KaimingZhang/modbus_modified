=============================


NAME
----
mc_rtu_set_serial_mode - set the serial mode


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int mc_rtu_set_serial_mode(mc_t *'ctx');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _mc_rtu_set_serial_mode()_ function shall set the selected serial
mode:

*MC_RTU_RS232*:: the serial line is set for RS232 communication. RS-232
 (Recommended Standard 232) is the traditional name for a series of standards
 for serial binary single-ended data and control signals connecting between a
 DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) and a DCE (Data Circuit-terminating
 Equipment). It is commonly used in computer serial ports

*MC_RTU_RS485*:: the serial line is set for RS485 communication. EIA-485,
 also known as TIA/EIA-485 or RS-485, is a standard defining the electrical
 characteristics of drivers and receivers for use in balanced digital multipoint
 systems. This standard is widely used for communications in industrial
 automation because it can be used effectively over long distances and in
 electrically noisy environments.

This function is only supported on Linux kernels 2.6.28 onwards.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _mc_set_serial_mode()_ function shall return 0 if successful. Otherwise
it shall return -1 and set errno to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
The current libmc backend is not RTU.

*ENOTSUP*::
The function is not supported on your platform.

If the call to ioctl() fails, the error code of ioctl will be returned.
